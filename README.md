# Customer-Churn-for-Telecom-Company
# Customer Churn Prediction using Logistic Regression

## Project Overview

This project aims to predict customer churn for a telecom company using machine learning techniques.
## Data Preprocessing

- Handled missing values using SimpleImputer with median strategy.
- Encoded categorical variables using LabelEncoder.
- Standardized numerical features using StandardScaler.

## Model Building

- Built a Logistic Regression model to predict customer churn.
- Evaluated the model using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.

## Results and Evaluation

- Achieved an accuracy of 81.5% on the test set.
- Precision, Recall, and F1-score were calculated for each class.
- Confusion matrix analysis provided insights into model performance.
